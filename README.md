# Algorithm Mentor – Multi-Agent AI Tutor for Algorithms

**Algorithm Mentor** is a multi-agent AI tutor for algorithms and data structures, built for stressed undergrads, returning learners, and ESL students.

It runs as a single Kaggle notebook and uses Google’s **Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite** and **Agent Development Kit (ADK)** to:

- Explain concepts with structured lessons and synthetic examples  
- Generate and auto-grade practice problems  
- Visualize algorithms step-by-step  
- Diagnose student needs and orchestrate specialist agents  
- Evaluate itself with a Judge Agent and basic metrics

> This repository accompanies my submission to the **Kaggle Agents Intensive – Agents for Good** track (education / tutoring).
